PHP JWT Example
===============

Very simple PHP based proof of concept for validating JSON Webtokens issued by AWS Cognito federeaded identities.

To install just run composer install and then hit the url /api.php?jwt=<TheAWSIssuedJSONWebToken>

The code is not intended for production, but serves as a Proof of concept.

Enjoy!
